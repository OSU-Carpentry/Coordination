Thanks for attending the workshop last [DAYHERE]! I need two more things from you:
1.	If you do not want to be on the workshop announcement mailing list, please email me and let me know.
2.	If you do want to be an OSU Carpentry volunteer and help or teach at more workshops like this in the future, please email me.
Donâ€™t forget to review the material on the Data Carpentry ([LINK HERE]) and Software Carpentry ([LINK HERE]) websites.
Thank you for attending the workshop!
