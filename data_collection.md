# Workflow for Data Collection

## Requirements
Before the workshop, we need to know names and emails of registered participants so we can send each participant an email with workshop instructions. This is usually done via mail merge with Outlook and Word. During the workshop, we collect attendance information. After the workshop, we combine data collected at registration with attendance data and archive it for reporting purposes.
