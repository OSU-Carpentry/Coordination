You were on the waiting list and did not get to attend our last [WORKSHOP TYPE] workshop. For this reason, I am contacting you, and everybody else who was on the waiting list, first to let you know registration for our next [WORKSHOP TYPE] workshop is now open. You can register at https://osu-carpentry.github.io/. [You need to register for each workshop in the series that you plan to attend. # If the workshop is a series.] If you have any questions, please let me know.
